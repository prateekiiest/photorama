<h2>My Undergraduate Life</h2>
<br>

<br>

Hi,
I am Prateek from India and I am currently a Computer Science undergraduate. It's been quite a great experience during my 2 years of journey in the field of Computer Science.
I have learnt many new topics which are intriguing and at the same time quite difficult. Maybe this is why I am in so love with this subject.

<br>
<br>

An avid problem solver on Hackerrank and HackerEarth. My interest is in mainly Algorithms and Data Structures.
Open Source Enthusiast - Had been an open source contributor since 2 years. See under Open Source Experience, where I have put up my current Open Source work.</h4>
<br>

Love Volunteering - Be it Technical or Non - Technical.
And lastly love Art and Music.
