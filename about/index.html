<h1>My Undergraduate Life</h1>

<h4>
Hi,
I am Prateek from India and I am currently a Computer Science undergraduate. It's been quite a great experience during my 2 years of journey in the field of Computer Science.
I have learnt many new topics which are intriguing and at the same time quite difficult. Maybe this is why I am in so love with this subject.
