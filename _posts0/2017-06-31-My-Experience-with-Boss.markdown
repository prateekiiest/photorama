### Bountiful Open Source Summer

As the name suggests, an open source event just like GSOC - this was great.

I was excited. This summer isn't gonna be boring.


One thing that I liked about BOSS is that it is open to all.

A Real Open Source Event

It has no registration process and anyone can start participating at any time within the referred period. Unlike GSOC, you don't have to write an application for a given project work and I find it really irrelevant. So BOSS stands out and I am really excited this summer to contribute to such a host of great projects under coding-blocks.

I first started working on the issues that didn't require much understanding of the whole code-base. Usually they had smaller bounty points.

Then as time went by , I went on to solve bigger issues - more bounty points.

Some of the issues were simple , while others made a big impact on the respective code-base.

And when people come to a place to solve a specific bug or issue which has been active for the past 2 - 3 weeks , and finally solve it, it is that joy of Open Source that you get.

It has been quite a great experience so far. I have been contributing for the past 2 weeks besides doing an internship at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur.

A cup of coffee, a good network connection and that's how I go on Open Sourcing.


Currently within top 10 contributors in the competition.
