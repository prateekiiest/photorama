<h3>Volunteer to Inspire the Youth</h3>

<br>

In an era, where computer science grows day and night , its really hard to keep the pace with it.
And its really hard to learn so much thing in such a short time. But sharing ideas is what helps the most.

I guess I first got introduced to teaching through volunteering at code.org. Its a program designed
to encourage youth into computer science. And the best part is anyone can become a volunteer, whether
you are a basket ball player or a maths teacher or a high school student.

I was asked by some teachers to volunteer and I worked with students closely on online, where I introduced
them to programming languages starting with the basic. Apart from that I also encouraged them to work
on the Code.org site puzzles and other stuffs to get much more passionate about coding.


And it was fun. I learnt a lot of new stuffs while teaching. I learnt about working on minecraft projects and a little bit
of C#. Overall it was exciting and fun.

<br>

Thank you Code.org for taking this initiative.
