### Contributing to Open Source Projects
#### Karan Projects

During this period I started contributing to small open source projects on Github.

I first started out with this project Karan Projects. This repository contains a list of about more than 100 problems on Algorithms on varied sections like Math, Sorting, Search and alike.

I had justed started learning about algorithms then, went through videos on MIT OpenCourseWare and brushed up my knowledge on some of the algorithms on Dynamic and Greedy.

Some of the PRs I had sent for this repository can be seen [here](https://github.com/karan/Projects-Solutions/pulls/prateekiiest)

As I continued , I found it was really working out for me. And it was just so encouraging for me.

#### LearnPython
Some time later I came upon this repository that contains some algorithms implemented in Python. I was in love with Algorithms at that point of time. And as a result I started contributing to such Algorithm projects to get a sound taste of it. Since most of the algorithms were already being implemented I started working on improving some of the code snippets and tried to give a more improved documentation for the repository.

My solutions include

It was really a great moment to contribute to such projects - it was simple but I enjoyed it.

I was learning about the Open Source culture little by little until I got to work on one of the major project of my life.

Stay tuned to know more.
