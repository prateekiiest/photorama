I have been an avid Open Source Enthusiast since 2 years.
I had been doing projects on my own as well as contributing to other's repositories/organisations as well.
Overall it has been a great experience so far, quite daunting at times and challenging also.

I didn't know much about Open Source then and it was not until June 2016 that I fully immersed myself in Open Source, contributing to projects, building my own projects on Github. 

I first started out with Github when I was doing a course on Machine Learning from Udacity. The course had some 5-6 projects that required to be done on Github for the review by Udacity. So it was then I started out with Github. Day by day, I worked on this project.

Initially I stumbled, didn't know how to use the git, about zero knowledge o Github work flow. I did some courses on Git and Github workflow, learnt Git and finally started in full swing. It was really challenging at first and I wished to give up. But I just went through it, made two to three projects, Udacity gave awesome reviews for them and ultimately that gave me a confidence.

Little by little I started doing Open Source , learnt the culture, started contributing to small projects - Humble Beginnings !
And that's how it all started out.

Every issue solved, every PR merged gave me a pat on the shoulder that I could do more and work with some of the amazing people around the world on some of the coolest projects in the world.

**Open Source is changing the world. Embrace yourselves!**
