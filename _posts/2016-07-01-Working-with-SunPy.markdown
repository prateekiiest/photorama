### My First Break through in Open Source (Science).

Like I said, I always had been an avid open source contributor. It all started when I was working on Udacity Projects on Machine Learning and Android Applications.

As I was contributing to small projects on Github apart from working on my own personal projects, I came to know about GSOC- **Google Summer of Code**.


I started working for it, searched for organizations primarily working in Science and Research. I always had a love for astronomy since childhood and wished to work on something related to it. And that landed me to the  **OpenAstronomy**  [page](http://openastronomy.org/).

**SunPy** is one of the projects that is currently being hosted by OpenAstronomy and I got interested in working on it.

#### A brief talk on SunPy

SunPy is a community-developed free and open-source software package for solar physics. It aims to be provide a comprehensive data analysis environment that allows researchers within the field of solar physics to carry out their tasks with the minimal effort.

SunPy is written using the Python programming language and is build upon the scientific Python environment which includes several core packages such as NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib and Pandas. Since SunPy deals with key astrophysical concepts, its development is closely associated with that of Astropy, which is a fundamental package within the Python astronomy ecosystem.

The SunPy package was established on the 28th of March 2011 by a small group of scientists and developers at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Since that time, SunPy have grown from this small group into large community python package.

#### How I got started with

If it wasn’t because of GSoc that I wanted to go for it,  it was the community’s work in the field of solar physics that interested me.
I went through the community’s work , read some of the papers published in this field, went through SunPy YouTube channel to get a fair knowledge of the community’s current work, its goals and ideas.

I first started with solving the beginner issues on Github and attempted them. My first PR was on an issue in the AIA plot which I took an entire day to solve . When the PR finally got merged with a token of appreciation **"Welcome to the SunPy community"**, it gave me a head start.

#### IRC (Internet Relay Chat)
I didn’t know much about this mode of communication. Later I got to understand that this where developers can talk and meet and we as students can contact mentors and clarify our doubts or seek help.

I started out in the IRC Channel with a simple installation doubt, which I was having during the initial days.
As days went on, I went through the beginner issues on the GitHub page. Well, at first it was too daunting , but I tried hard. I solved about 12 issues, sent 15 -17 Pull Requests, opened 3–4 issues. All listed  [here](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aprateekiiest+is%3Aclosed).

----------------------------------------

### Pre-Gsoc
I loved working on the project. I worked on implementing the AIA plots, some parts of the MGN algorithm for detecting coronal loops, coordinate transformations of the solar plot.

I also worked on improving the documentation of SunPy which lacked important information in some places like documentation on function attributes and class diagrams.

As a part of the GSOC project I later started working on improving the website, creating an affiliated packages registry, creating a blog system and also uploading some presentations and talks on the website. Also I started out with improving the documentation including more Gallery Examples for AIA plots and solving some bugs.


-----------------------------------------

#### Alas!  I did not get selected

In spite of the hard work I put in, I could not qualify for GSOC. Maybe it was due to the application that failed to create a spark or I did not clearly mention in detail the technologies that I would be using which resulted rejection.

I seek a review from one of mentors about what went wrong in the application and how I could have improved it.

But its Open Source !! and I can still contribute.

------------------------------------------
### Post-GSOC

I took a 2 months leave from working with this project, as I was busy undergoing a research internship.

After about 2-3 months , I came back again and started working on the project.
There were those GSOC students and there was I still working on it.

Maybe you will be thinking, that I am preparing for the next GSOC.

I would say NO.

I wanted to work on this and contribute because this was the thing that I loved spending time on.

I would even work through out the night solving issues or working on some self-project using SunPy even when I know that semesters are knocking at the door.

And its best when you find out that hard work does pay off at last.

The momentary disappointment of not being selected for GSOC was completely taken aside by one thing.


### Getting Acknowledged

It was something really great for me to able to work on such a project in close relation with NASA scientists and scholars in the SunPy community.

And hence for all those little work , I had put into this project, I got acknowledged for my work when my name got listed with the entire SunPy community and NASA scientists as a research project on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/1015699).

**And that too for 4 times in a row !!!**

I mean what could be better than that.

### Future Work

It was a really a great experience for me to work with such a huge community on such an idea. I am still working with the team and I look forward to contributing more to the community in the future.

Recently I have been working on contributing illustrative Examples for the Gallery section including AIA data analysis and detecting peaks in the solar data.

I am also working with HFC (Heliographic Features) to extract features like sunspots , active regions etc. from the solar data and analyzing them over time.

And about GSOC - Let's see if it works out this year.

But I guess `In the end, it doesn't even matter`.
