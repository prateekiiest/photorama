### My First Break through in Open Source.

As I was contributing to small projects on Github apart from working on my own personal projects, I came to know about GSOC- **Google Summer of Code**.

So I started working for it, searched for projects on Science and Research. I always had a love for astronomy since childhood and wished to work on something realated to it. And that brought me to **OpenAstronomy**.

**SunPy** is one of the projects that is currently being hosted by OpenAstronomy.

#### A brief talk on SunPy

SunPy is a community-developed free and open-source software package for solar physics. It aims to be provide a comprehensive data analysis environment that allows researchers within the field of solar physics to carry out their tasks with the minimal effort.

SunPy is written using the Python programming language and is build upon the scientific Python environment which includes several core packages such as NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib and Pandas. Since SunPy deals with key astrophysical concepts, its development is closely associated with that of Astropy, which is a fundamental package within the Python astronomy ecosystem.

The SunPy package was established on the 28th of March 2011 by a small group of scientists and developers at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Since that time, SunPy have grown from this small group into large community python package.

#### How I got started with

It wasn’t because of GSoc that I wanted to go for it but it was the community’s work in the field of solar physics that interested me.
I went through the community’s work , read some of its papers , went through YouTube tutorials to get a fair knowledge of the community’s current work, its goals and ideas.
I then tried solving the beginner issues on Github and attempted them. My first PR was on an issue in the AIA plot which I had solved within a day. When the PR finally got merged with a token of appreciation **"Welcome to the SunPy community"**, it gave me a head start.

#### IRC (Internet Relay Chat)
I didn’t know much about this mode of communication, but I had experience in gitter and slack.
I started out in the IRC Channel with a simple installation doubt, which I was having for a few days.
As days went on, I went through the beginner issues on the github page. Well, at first it was too daunting , but I tried hard. I solve about 12 issues, sent 15 -17 Pull Requests, opened 3–4 issues. You can see them [here](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aprateekiiest+is%3Aclosed).

I loved working on the project. I workedon implementing the AIA plots, some parts of the MGN algorithm for detecting coronal loops, coordingate transformations of the solar plot. I later started working on improving the website, creating an affliated pakages registry, creating a blog system and also uploading some presentations and talks on the website.

It was a really a great experience for me to work with such a huge community on such an idea. I am still working with the team an look forward to contributing more to the community in the future.
